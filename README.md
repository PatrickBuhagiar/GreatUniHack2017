# ReMUMber

For Great Uni Hack 2017 (Manchester), we decided to go with one wackiest idea we could think of. We were targeting the American Express prize, where the criteria was to come up with an innovative travel companion app. 

We definitely could have gone with a more serious problem, however we decided to choose something fun and avoid being too stressed out for the weekend. 

The idea we chose was an Android app that reminds you that you should text your mother (hence reMUMber). The app could also send an automated text message based on the context.

So for example, if you've just landed at a new city, a notification would pop up reminding you to text your mother. an action in the notification can then send an automated message to your mother saying that you arrived safely at said city. 
Another feature was that it could remind you that today is her birthday. 

We didn't really use any fancy algorithms or tech for this project. Only one of us had the basic knowledge about Android, so the rest of us took this as an opportunity to learn Android.
